Files for HCDE410SP22 - Final

This final project aims to compare the [Top Streamers on Twitch](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/twitchdata) and [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) datasets. With these datasets, this project aims to compare discoverability of synchronous platforms, specifically individual channels, and how their engagement relates to this discoverability.
