I am planning on analyzing Twitch data and Google Trends to understand how users discover content and remain on a platform. I am interested in examining a synchronous platform such as Twitch and view how individuals find themselves engaged, specifically by continuing to view or return to a streamer. From a human-centered perspective, it will be interesting to attempt to learn what how our patterns vary in searches and watchtime, if determinable, though this may be difficult. From a scientific perspective, it may be useful to compare effort (in stream time) with results (of watch time) and gather insights around this. I'm hoping to learn more about how we discover synchronous platforms (exact search terms versus general), in this case a specific streamer's channel, and how engaged we stay on these platforms.

Originally I planned to only examine one dataset, the Top Streamers on Twitch, but found that my goals and end result may be rather limited in this regard. My idea was not scoped much as I simply considered a potential dataset to explore. In speaking to a peer, I was pushed to consider the reasoning behind this data generally or how I might use this data to represent something, such as the significance viewership or watch time rather than simply comparing the Twitch data to itself. I later aimed to tie with another dataset which became the Google Trends data.

With the [Top Streamers on Twitch](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/twitchdata) and [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) data, I believe I have a strong set of large data to understand search patterns with watch times and viewer count to discern possible patterns. While there are many external factors in maintaining viewership, I believe there may be some correlation with search patterns and discovering, rediscovering, or simply routing to certain platforms. 

[Top Streamers on Twitch](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/twitchdata) contains a Twitch channel name, watch time, stream time, peak viewers, average viewers, followers, followers gained, views gained, whether a channel is partnered with Twitch, and if a channel is content-restricted being mature for those 18+. This data is scraped and represents this information over one year. This dataset is under the CC0: Public Domain license. The data can be used to draw connections with search queries to try and identify any patterns or correlations with values such as watch time, follower gain, or viewership. Usage of this dataset presents no ethical considerations in the context of this project but data may be limited or skewed by other factors such as viewbotting.

[Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) allows one to search for a search query such as Twitch or a channel name and returns information such as interest over time on a scale from 0 to 100, interest by subregion and location, related topics, and related search queries. Data is sortable by customizing time ranges which can match up with the year that the top streamers data was scraped and collected. When using Trends data, one must attribute the information to Google with a citation. For example, add "Data source: Google Trends (https://www.google.com/trends)." The data can be used to draw connections with Twitch stream data to understand if search queries have an effect on stream data. No ethical issues are foreseen in the context of this project.

With these datasets, I acknowledge the results of this project do not fully detail patterns as there are other variables not controlled such as type of stream, content, connectivity, or scheduling (for both viewers and streamers). In this regard, the results will likely be limited. While a minimum viable product detailing discoveries can be shared by the end of the quarter, it may not be fully flushed out due to the time constraint of four weeks. Additionally, these datasets are in CSV format only which means the data may not be as complex but is easy to read and process.
